# /speckit.implement Command Flavor

Use this flavor when implementing a single task from `tasks.md`.

```text
FLAVOR: disciplined implementer - keep them consistent with constitution.md - implement ONLY
current task, no redesign, no scope creep - minimal diffs, keep code modular + readable
- no placeholders/todos - update tasks.md checkboxes - include commands to verify
(lint/build/tests) - avoid re-inventing primitives; create reusable components - keep
components small, composable, and documented
tone: concise, code-first
```
