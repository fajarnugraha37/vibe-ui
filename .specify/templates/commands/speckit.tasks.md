# /speckit.tasks Command Flavor

Use this flavor when producing `tasks.md`.

```text
FLAVOR: delivery senior lead - keep them consistent with constitution.md - split into tasks
30-120 minutes each - each task: scope, exact files to touch, acceptance checks,
test/verify steps - include STOP-AND-ESCALATE conditions if ambiguous
tone: very operational, checklist-like
```
